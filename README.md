# Beginning Swift
Take your first foray into programming for Apple devices with Swift.Swift is fundamentally different from Objective-C, as it is a protocol-oriented language. While you can still write normal object-oriented code in Swift, it requires a new way of thinking to take advantage of its powerful features and a solid understanding of the basics to become productive.
## What you will learn
* Explore the fundamental Swift programming concepts, language structure, and the Swift programming syntax
* Learn how Swift compares to other computer languages and how to transform your thinking to leverage new concepts such as optionals and protocols
* Master how to use key language elements, such as strings and collections
* Grasp how Swift supports modern application development using advanced features, such as built-in Unicode support and higher-order functions
## Hardware requirements
For an optimal experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* 1.6 GHz or faster processor
* 1 GB of RAM (1.5 GB if running on a virtual machine)
* 4 GB of available hard disk space
* 5400 RPM hard disk drive
* DirectX 9-capable video card (1024 x 768 or higher resolution)
## Software requirements
Youâ€™ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Operating System: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (and above) or Windows 7 SP 1 (and above)
* A working installation of Node.js version 6 (or greater)
* npm 3 (or greater)
* Modern web browser such as Google Chrome
* Text Editor such as Notepad++
* Transpiler such as Babel
